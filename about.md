# About
<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" style="border-radius: 100%" alt="Profilbild">

<p>Hi there! I'm someone who loves throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. Not, like, literally, more in the sense that I love experimenting with different <i>modi operandi</i> and perspectives when trying to make connections or solve a problem. It's a complex world out there, so I believe it is important to keep learning at every step of the way.</p>

<p>That's also what I spent the last few years doing: learning. I have a Bachelor's Degree in German Literature and Language and Political Science from the University of Freiburg and a Master's Degree in German and Comparative Literature from both the University of Bonn (M.A.) and the University of St Andrews. Furthermore, I made ventures into Culture Studies, Sociology, Philosophy and Cognitive science during an interdisciplinary study year during my Bachelor's.</p>

<p>At the moment, I am mostly fascinated by 19th-century literature and culture as well as the multifaceted field called Digital Humanities. You can find more information on my preoccupation with the latter <a class="link" href="{{ site.url }}/dighum">here</a>.</p>
